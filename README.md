# BetterWorldStats
##### (Forked from RemainingToast, which was forked from WorldStatsRewritten by moomoo.)

Things this fork has that seperates it from other worldstats plugins:
- Async world size check
- Update of unique players everytime a new player joins
- Language display based on client locale (Multilang)
- Additional placeholders, enabling you to add all infos from the command into for ex. tablist (requires PlaceholderAPI)
- Separate permissions for all plugin commands
- Reload (and Version) command
- A more clear and understandable config file
- Option to disable console logging in config

#### Supports 1.12.2 - 1.19.4.
