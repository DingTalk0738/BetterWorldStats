# BetterWorldStats
(Forked from RemainingToast, which was forked from WorldStatsRewritten by moomoo.)

Things this fork has that seperates it from others:
- Async world size check
- Language display based on client locale (Multilang)
- /betterws reload and version command
- Additional placeholders, so infos from the /worldstats command can be used in sometinhg like tablist
- Seperate permissions for all plugin commands

Plugin is written in java 8, so 1.12 is the lowest tested version that it works on.
